# The BMA "/bma-security-fix" command. Everything shared with the other BMA
# repositories lives in egym/egym-ai-toolkit; only this repository's own
# ecosystem is configured here.
#
# The import is pinned to a commit SHA. Bump it, run `gh aw compile` and
# commit the regenerated lock to pick up shared changes; imports resolve at
# compile time, so nothing changes until you do.

    # BOTH entries are required for dual mode. gh-aw emits one activation clause per
    # entry and ORs them: issue_comment gives `issue.pull_request == null` (issue mode)
    # and pull_request_comment gives `issue.pull_request != null` (pull request mode).
    # Listing only one silently disables the other mode.
    # By default only users with write access can invoke it. Keep that default.

# gh-aw requires the consuming workflow to grant every permission its imports
# need, so this block cannot live in the shared file.

# The shared prompt is a RUNTIME import, and gh-aw validates its expressions
# against a safe list that excludes `github.event.issue.pull_request`, so the
# prompt cannot tell the two modes apart on its own. Resolving it here works
# because GitHub, not gh-aw, evaluates workflow YAML. `env.*` IS safe-listed.
# gh-aw emits this at workflow level, so the activation job that renders the
# prompt inherits it.

## Repository-specific rules

- Run **every** `npm` command through the `npm-run` tool, which installs dependencies first.
